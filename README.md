Hello,

The code provided is esentually a GUI for some common engineeering formulas in wave analysis, solid mechanics, therodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, electronics, manufacturing, etc. To use the code directly, just download and run "SEF_App_Version_A_Standalone.exe". Then a screen similar to below will show:

From this, please choose the subject you want to get formulas for in the "Select Libary" dropdown:

Afterwards, please pick the function you need from the libary in the "Select Function". Once this is done, the "Input Prameters" boxes will show up. Please fill these inputs to the best of your ability. If you are confused what these inputs stand for, please look at the documentation to the right side of the screen:

When you are done with this, please click the "Calcualte" button at the bottom. This will get you the results in the "Output Data" section. If the function is best represented as a graph, please look at the "Output Figure" section:

If you wish to manipulate the exe file directly, please download and unzip "SEF App Version A.zip". If you wish to have the raw python libaries in one place to use without the GUI, please use "SEF Code Libary". Use code at your own risk.
